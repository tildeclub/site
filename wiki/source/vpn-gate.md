`VPN Gate` is a project from U Tsukuba in Japan that allows you to 
evade censorship and filtering by setting up VPN tunnels. It was
designed with the Great Firewall of China in mind.

You may need client side software to make this work; [tunnelblick](tunnelblick.html) is one
such service on the Mac.
