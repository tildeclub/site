## got a topic you want to write about?

or maybe you just found a typo on one of the existing pages!

follow these steps to submit a change.

1. grab a copy of the site's source code

    git clone https://github.com/tildeclub/site tilde.club && cd tilde.club/wiki

1. make a new article or update an existing one. make sure that you create the
   title and author keys in the yaml frontmatter (see an existing article for
   an example)

1. submit the code via a PR on github or with git-send-email(1) to root@tilde.club
   see [git-send-email.io](https://git-send-email.io) for more info on how to use
   it. if you're working locally on tilde.club, you won't have to configure
   anything; git will use the system's sendmail to handle the email.

1. profit???

ask on irc if you have questions!
