## 2. tilde.club mission

**tilde.club exists to foster an engaged community for socializing, learning,
and making cool stuff**

in a mass-media age, it is up to small, intentional communities to gather
and work together to provide a space outside of the advertising-laden,
profit-seeking, corporate-owned world of social media.

to that end, tilde.club strives to be a radically inclusive community where
people of all backgrounds and all technological experience levels can come
together to learn, to teach, and to delight in one another's creations.

  * attempt collaboration before conflict.
