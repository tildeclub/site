# Help Wanted
Tilde.club is moving very quickly and is 100% volunteer led.

## 1. optimal: pull requests and bug reports
- There is a lot of great work going on around config, FAQ, basic docs.
- Jump in if you want. Literally everyone here said "I am ready to help, what can I do."
- We need non-coders  (writers, editors, communicators, artists, project managers) as much as we need tech folks.
- Most of the coding work is done for us by the Unix operating system. We're celebrating that.
- A lot of the basic docs are in the [wiki](https://github.com/tildeclub/tilde.club/wiki) which you (yes, you) can edit.

## 2. suboptimal: open ended feature requests and broad discussion
- We love philosophy, just not in our issue tracker!
